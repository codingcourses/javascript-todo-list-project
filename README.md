In this project, we will be building out a todo list app. We will continue to practice with MVC, DOM
manipulation, `localStorage`, and learn about using third-party libraries.
[UIkit](https://getuikit.com/) will be used for icons, and [uuid](https://github.com/uuidjs/uuid)
will be used for generating IDs.

## Learning Goals

These are specific topics covered in this project:

- MVC design pattern
- DOM manipulation
- `localStorage`
- Third-party libraries: [UIkit](https://getuikit.com/), [uuid](https://github.com/uuidjs/uuid)
